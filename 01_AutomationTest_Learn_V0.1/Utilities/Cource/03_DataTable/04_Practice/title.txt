Calculate the sum in two Excel files

Suppose we need to calculate the sum of the values from two different columns in an Excel file in three way and store the value in the third column.

Create a workflow that adds the values on column A with values on column B and writes them in column C in different ways:  

Keeps the Excel open and writes the results in real-time, row by row so you can see the changes. 
Keeps the Excel closed, set the column values in the memory Data Table and adds all the tables to a new Excel file at once, in the end. 
Calculates the sum by using Excel formulas in the original file.
